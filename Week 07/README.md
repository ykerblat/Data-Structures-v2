To initiate this exercise:
- a new AWS account had to be created from scratch (this time as root user **_not_** as an IAM user), followed by the creation of a new AWS Cloud 9 environment dedicated to this assignment. 
- In addition, an RDS instance database (via AWS) has been setup, and we've also adjusted the security parameters accordingly to include an additional rule.

The starter code (see below for more details) was provided to faciliate the creation of a database with the aa data (by using directly the JSON file).

**Part A**
In this section, after exploring/testing some of the main commands in SQL Lite (accessible via the https://sqliteonline.com/), we are extracted the same addresses from the previous AA assignment (as seen in previous documentation the JSON file with the geo-referenced is called PreciseLocation.json - https://github.com/ykerblat/Data-Structures-v2/blob/main/Week%2007/PreciseLocation.jsonlocated which can also be found in this folder to facilitate cross-referencing).
