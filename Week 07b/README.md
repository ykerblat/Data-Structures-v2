**Part A - Confirming AA Locations with initial SQL query **

In this part, we are using the starter code to get more familiar with a standard/oft-cited SQL query to select the data that was extracted from the original AA website, and input it in a table (by using the cTable function 'console.table) - see below.

In order to obtain and visualize the "console.table", it's important to adapt the login credentials at the onset of the script (we've also referred the SQL table as 'aalocations') - see below.
