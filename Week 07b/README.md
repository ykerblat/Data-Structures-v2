_This assignment was finalized after class that was dedicated to this exercise on October 20._

**Step 1**

Initially, I had a rough concept of my DB schema from [Week 5](https://github.com/ykerblat/Data-Structures-v2/blob/main/Week%2005/Data%20Structures%20-%20Week%205%20Assignment%20-%20Process%20Blog%20Schema-%20Yann%20Kerblat.pdf), but after reading the SQL and Dynamo DB documentation, I decided to simplify - for example by removing any nested data items, reorganizing the sequencing of the information and be more specific with specific areas.

I'm re-attaching the initial schema below to facilitate cross-referencing.

**Step 2** 

Based on the information/suggestions provided by the starter code, I managed to find a way

Using the starter code, create a template to insert the information of your process blog. Once the template is created with string, boolean, or number values, you can push the information into the object created. (blogEntries) For now, we are just console logging to confirm the information is there and correct.
