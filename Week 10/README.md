<h2> Final Assignments - Design instructions </h2>
You will design three interfaces for visualizations for your three data sources (AA, process blog, and sensors). NOTE: there is no coding in this assignment. This is strictly a design exercise; the coding will be done for your final assignment submissions.

You will submit sketches, materials, and documentation for your designs, which should include (at a minimum) the following information for each of the three designs for final assignments 1, 2, and 3:

- What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
- How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
- For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
- What is the default view (if any)?
- What assumptions are you making about the user?

<b> Submission requirements </b>
Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). Use GitHub markdown to document your sketches and other materials. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your data-structures GitHub repository.
