_Assignment 2

_Part One: Plan Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for your "Process Blog" data to be stored in this database table. Include all the content/data/variables from your "Process Blog" project that you believe to be relevant. Upload an image (png format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository.
_
Some decisions that will help with this drawing:

_Will you use a Normalized Data Model or a Denormalized Data Model? Why? When the data comes back out of the database, how should it be structured? Why? How would you describe the hierarchy of the data?
_
Part Two: Create some data and test its fit in Word
Using Word, populate three dummy NoSQL database entries that represent various plausible Process Blog entries (it's ok to use Lorem Ipsum for the text)._

For this project, I'm using my Spotify "Discovery Weekly" playlist (which is a playlist of new songs randomly generated on a weekly basis). Every time I hear a song that I like I save it in a separate folder on my app. Using the denormalized data model, I plan to track surface-level information and will use the process blog method to create a record keeping (name of the song, year, name of artist, country origin) based on the proposed scheme (see below).
