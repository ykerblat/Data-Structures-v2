# Process Blog project
### by Yann Kerblat

<strong>Objective </strong>  The objective of this project was to draw a data model for our own "Process Blog" data, which can be stored in a given database table. There was flexibility on the choice of content/data/variables to structure this "Process Blog", as long as it was relevant. My process blog is a musical exploration of songs I have randomly come across through the Spotify music application. 


## Instructions

<em> You will expand on weekly assignments 5, 6, and 10 to capture, clean, and store all data for "Process Blog"--a source of semi-structured, qualitative data. The data should be stored in Amazon DynamoDB and queried using the aws-sdk module in Node. You will design and create an interface to display relevant diary entries. </em>


<!-- Similar to the AA meeting process, what is important in this conceptual work is to provide the user the ability to filter, explore, sort different dataseets on an interface that is able to update information on a regular basis whilst displaying quantitative and qualitative ratings of song
