# Final Project Assignments

## Assignment 1 - AA Meeting Data

The objective of this project was to scrape, extract and re-format all the data from the previous NYC Anonymous Alcoholics (AA) website and re-calibrate the interface into a more intuitive, dynamic, and user-friendly application. More specifically, this project strives to rebuild an application that could be  designed in a more comprehensive manner by using "meeting sites" (geographical data), meeting time slots as well as weekdays to guide the user towards the information he/she is looking forward to. AWS PostrgreSQL databased was use to host the previously-mentioned information.

## Assignment 2 - Process Blog "Musical Exploration"

The objective of this project was to draw a data model for our own "Process Blog" data, which can then be stored in a given database table. For this project, I'm using my Spotify "Discovery Weekly" playlist (which is a playlist of new songs randomly generated on a weekly basis based on my musical preferences and listening habits) for my process blog. In other words, every time I hear a song that I appreciated, I bookmark it in a separate playlist. I am recording and tracking basic information and intend to use the process blog to maintain a record keeping mechanism (name of the song, duration, country origin, name of the artist, etc.). Dynamo AWS database was created for this assignment in order to store/activate information.
